**Consequences:**
- Self-documenting APIs
- Interactive API documentation
- Additional development overhead for annotations
- Improved API consistency

## 4. Contact Management Implementation
**Date:** 2024-01-02

**Decision:** Implement comprehensive contact management with phone/email validation and call tracking

**Context:**
- Need to manage contacts with multiple phones and emails
- Must support AU/NZ phone number formats
- Should track call history and status
- Must maintain audit logs
- Must enforce tenant isolation

**Consequences:**
- Robust phone number validation for AU/NZ
- Configurable limits for phones/emails
- Complete audit trail of all changes
- Proper soft deletion support
- Comprehensive test coverage

## 5. Testing Strategy
**Date:** 2024-01-02

**Decision:** Implement multi-layer testing approach with unit, integration, and performance tests

**Context:**
- Need comprehensive test coverage
- Must verify tenant isolation
- Should test performance under load
- Must validate business rules

**Consequences:**
- High test coverage across all layers
- Performance benchmarks established
- Tenant isolation verified
- Increased development time
- Better code quality assurance

## 6. Configuration Management
**Date:** 2024-01-02

**Decision:** Use environment-based configuration with sensible defaults

**Context:**
- Need flexible configuration
- Must support multiple environments
- Should be easily overridable
- Must maintain security

**Consequences:**
- Environment-specific settings
- Configurable limits and rules
- Easy local development
- Clear configuration documentation

## 8. PostgreSQL as Primary Database
**Date:** 2024-03-19

**Decision:** Use PostgreSQL as the primary database for production environments

**Context:**
- Need robust multi-tenant data isolation
- Complex querying requirements for contacts
- JSON storage for audit logs
- Array types for phone/email collections
- Performance considerations for large datasets

**Consequences:**
- Better performance for multi-tenant queries
- More efficient JSON operations
- Native array type support
- More complex deployment requirements
- SQLite remains for testing only

## 9. Remove Eloquent Factory
**Date:** 2024-03-19

**Decision:** Remove ContactFactory and use Doctrine's test data creation

**Context:**
- We're using Doctrine DBAL/ORM for database access
- The existing ContactFactory was using Eloquent patterns
- Test data creation should be consistent with our data access layer

**Consequences:**
- More consistent test data creation using Doctrine
- Removed unnecessary Eloquent dependencies
- Tests will use repository pattern for data creation
- Better alignment with chosen architecture

## 10. Module Structure
**Date:** 2024-03-19

**Decision:** Organize code into a modular structure under src/ directory

**Context:**
- Need clear separation of concerns
- Must follow Laravel module best practices
- Should support easy maintenance and testing
- Must support future scalability

**Consequences:**
- Better code organization
- Clear module boundaries
- Easier to maintain and test
- Better developer experience
- Consistent with Laravel module standards

## 11. Response Structure
**Date:** 2024-03-19

**Decision:** Use dedicated response interfaces and implementations

**Context:**
- Need consistent API responses
- Must support multiple response formats
- Should be easily extensible
- Must handle errors consistently

**Consequences:**
- Consistent response structure
- Better type safety
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to maintain and test
- Better API documentation

## 12. Response Interfaces
**Date:** 2024-03-19

**Decision:** Create separate interfaces for different response types

**Context:**
- Need to handle different response scenarios (single, collection, error)
- Must maintain consistent response structure
- Should support pagination
- Must be extensible for future response types

**Consequences:**
- Clear contract for response objects
- Easy to add new response types
- Consistent error handling
- Better type safety
- Improved maintainability

## 13. Domain-Driven Design with Doctrine
**Date:** 2024-03-19

**Decision:** Switch from procedural DBAL to DDD-style ORM usage

**Context:**
- Previous implementation was procedural using DBAL
- Need better domain modeling and encapsulation
- Want to leverage Doctrine ORM's full capabilities
- Should follow DDD principles for better maintainability

**Consequences:**
- Better domain modeling with proper entities
- Richer object-oriented design
- More maintainable business logic
- Clearer domain boundaries
- Better encapsulation of business rules
- More testable code structure

## 14. DDD Architecture Layers
**Date:** 2024-03-19

**Decision:** Implement strict DDD layering with Doctrine ORM

**Context:**
- Need clear separation between domain and infrastructure
- Want to protect domain model from persistence details
- Must support complex business rules
- Should enable better testing and maintenance

**Consequences:**
- Clear architectural boundaries
- Domain model protected from infrastructure concerns
- Better testability through abstraction
- More focused repositories
- Cleaner service layer
- Improved maintainability
